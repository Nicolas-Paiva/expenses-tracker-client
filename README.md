# Expense Mate - Client

This is the frontend application for Expense Mate, a simple full-stack expense tracker.

Users can create, update, and delete expenses, and visualize their spending with charts. The app is built with Next.js and React.

## Live Demo

Check out the live app here: https://expenses-tracker-client-ten.vercel.app/

Obs: The application server might take some time to respond to the first request due to the free hosting service taking some time to spin up the server.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (React framework)
- React Query (data fetching and caching)
- DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS (for styling)

## Running Locally

If you want to run the client locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expenses-tracker-client.git
cd expenses-tracker-client
npm install
npm run dev
